This plugin is the best way to give your customers the ability to add themselves to your contacts database in our site, where you'll be free to send them your emails, surveys and SMS messages. To get started: activate the plugin and then go to your iP.1 Settings page to set up your API key.

== Description ==

The plugin is built to complement other iP.1 services. iP.1 delivers a wide variety of communication services that allows you to send SMS, surveys or emails to your contacts.

To use the plugin you need to first register an account. You can register an account on the following page. [New account](https://shop.ip1.net/en-US/account/new).
When the account is active you need to set up an API key to paste in the token field in the plugin. You can create your API key in the [Portal](https://portal.ip1.net/).
If everything is set up correctly contacts that are added in the form should appear in the [Contact app](https://contacts.ip1.net/) and be ready to use in our services.
